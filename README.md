# Designing LLM Applications with Partial Autonomy

This repository contains a comprehensive blog post about designing LLM applications with partial autonomy—systems that augment human capability while maintaining human oversight through fast generation-verification loops.

## 📄 Blog Post

The main blog post is available in [`index.md`](./index.md) (served as the homepage). This is a detailed, technical deep-dive covering:

- Core architectural principles of partial autonomy
- Real-world case studies (Cursor and Perplexity)
- System design patterns and best practices
- Handling failures and edge cases
- Future directions in partial autonomy

## 🖼️ Diagrams

All diagrams are included in the [`images/`](./images/) directory:

- `verification_loop_diagram.svg` - The core generation-verification loop
- `autonomy_slider_diagram.svg` - Four levels of autonomy delegation
- `cursor_vs_perplexity_comparison.svg` - Side-by-side comparison of case studies
- `system_architecture_diagram.svg` - Complete system architecture
- `generation_verification_loop_detailed.svg` - Detailed loop with principles
- `fundamental_questions_diagram.svg` - Four fundamental design questions
- `design_principles_checklist.svg` - Visual checklist of design principles
